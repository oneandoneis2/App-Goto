=head1 NAME

App::Goto - Utility for accessing remote servers via SSH

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use App::Goto;

  my $goto = App::Goto->({ config => $config, args => $args });

  system( $goto->cmd );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

App::Goto is designed to make it as easy as possible to access remote servers
via SSH, allowing you to give the shortest possible unique string needed to
identify the server, and optionally to specify what command to run upon login -
such as changing to a frequently-used directory for you.

Requires a hashref of config details that define hosts & commands;
and an arrayref of arguments to define the specific host & command to use.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 is_success

Boolean, returns true if the passed-in arguments were correctly parsed.
Otherwise false.

=head2 error

If is_success is false, this should give a useful reason why.

=head2 cmd

Returns the command string calculated based on the passed-in args & config

=head2 nick

Returns the calculated nickname from the possibly-ambiguous supplied argument.

=head2 host

Returns the actual hostname for the supplied nickname.
